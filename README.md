I have used an inbuilt dataset,you can change the dataset and values of columns and rows according to your dataset.
This is a python file and needs python extension along with pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn libraries installed in your pc.
"df = sns.load_dataset('tips')" here 'tips' is an inbuilt dataset and you can change it with your dataset location.
df.head() will print the column and rows values in tabular format.
